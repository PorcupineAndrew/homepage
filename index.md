My research focuses on <b style="color=2496CB;">Internet routing security</b> in the AI era. I am passinate about developing practical, AI-driven solutions to address both enduring and emerging threats in today's Internet routing system, with works published in top venues such as USENIX Security and NDSS. I received the Distinguished Paper Award and the Internet Defense Prize at USENIX Security 2024 for research on BGP routing anomaly detection. I also collaborate closely with the operator community, IETF, and China Telecom, striving for real-world impact and deployment at scale.
