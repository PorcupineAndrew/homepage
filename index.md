## About Me

Hi! I am a Ph.D. candidate in Computer Science at Tsinghua University (expected graduation: June 2026), co-advised by Prof. [Jianping Wu](https://www.internethalloffame.org/inductee/jianping-wu/) and Prof. [Qi Li](https://sites.google.com/site/qili2012/) in the [Network & Information Security Lab (NISL)](https://netsec.ccert.edu.cn/en/). My research focuses on **Internet routing security** in the AI era. I am passinate about developing practical, AI-driven solutions to address both enduring and emerging threats in today's Internet routing system, with works published in top venues such as USENIX Security and NDSS. I received the Distinguished Paper Award and the Internet Defense Prize at USENIX Security 2024 for research on BGP routing anomaly detection. I also collaborate closely with the operator community, IETF, and China Telecom, striving for real-world impact and deployment at scale.
